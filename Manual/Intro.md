### Using the groups
_(This covers basic usage for all games)_

Use of the groups is quite simple.
![[Pasted image 20211231164852.png]]
First go into append and find where you put FrostBlend on your computer.
![[Pasted image 20220726195407.png]]
Once in the Blend, select Material and append the materials you wish to add.
![[Pasted image 20220726195449.png]]
The FrostBlend material contains all nodegroups.
The other two are example materials that help with setting things up a bit quicker.

To use these in your own material...
![[Pasted image 20220726195729.png]]
Go to the add tab of the shader editor and select group. From here you can select the groups you wish to use in your own material. Please see the Usable Groups section for what ones you should append.
