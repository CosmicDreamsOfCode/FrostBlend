## Slice

Slice textures are used frequently in SWBF2 to add extra detail to the materials of models.

This is an example of a slice texture. 
Each shade of grey is a seperate mask. How this is handled in the groups is through a _Slice Sample_ value. Use can colour pick an AOSL texture directly to use this. If slice is elsewhere you will need to manually input the value onto the green channel of the sample input of your choice.
